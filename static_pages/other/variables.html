<h2>When do you define a variable?</h2>
          <p>
			An app remembers things, it has “hidden” memory. Think of it like a spreadsheet 
			of data in the app’s private “brain”. 
			You, the programmer, control the memory. When you drag a component
			 (e.g., button, text box) into your app, each of the components has a set of 
			 <em>properties</em>. These properties are “spreadsheet” cells that you can change. 
			 You can also define new “spreadsheet” cells called <em>variables</em> when 
			 you need to remember something. You define a variable when there isn’t a 
			 component property for storing the information you need. Check out these examples 
			 of using variables to remember things:

       <div class="row-fluid">
       	<div class="span6">
       	<a name="circle"></a> 
		  <h3>Example 1. How do you make it so that each time the user clicks a larger circle is drawn?</h3>
		    <img class="thumbnail" src="../../assets/img/variables/circleSize.png" border="0"/>
		   <p>
			When <span class="empfont">Canvas1</span> is touched, <span class="empfont">DrawCircle</span> 
			is called to draw a circle at the touch location 
			(<span class="empfont">x</span> and <span class="empfont">y</span>). The radius 
			<span class="empfont">r</span> cannot be a fixed number as we want a different-sized circle 
			each time. The variable <span class="empfont">circleSize</span> is used to keep track of-- to remember-- the size 
			of the circles each time we draw one. <span class="empfont">circleSize</span> is initialized to 1 so the first circle 
			drawn is a small dot. At the bottom of  each <span class="empfont">Canvas1.Touched</span> 
			event handler, <span class="empfont">circleSize</span> is doubled. So the second time the circle will be of radius 2, 
			then 4, then 8, etc.
			The variable <span class="empfont">circleSize</span> is needed because there is no component property that can be used. 
			The component <span class="empfont">Canvas</span> has a <span class="empfont">lineWidth</span> property, so if you were drawing lines you wouldn’t 
			need to define a variable. But <span class="empfont">Canvas</span> doesn’t have a <span class="empfont">circleSize
			</span> property, so you must define it as a variable.

		<h3>Example 2. How do you make a ball go back and forth across the screen?</h3>
		<img class="thumbnail" src="../../assets/img/variables/backAndForth.png" border="0"/>
		<p>
			In this example, a variable <span class="empfont">distance</span> is defined so the app can remember (keep track of) 
			the current direction the ball is moving. You want the ball to move on each clock timer event, 
			so the ball’s horizontal location (<span class="empfont">Ball1.X</span>) is changed (set) within 
			the <span class="empfont">Clock1.Timer</span> event handler. 
			The complicated part is you don’t always want to move the ball the same amount. When the ball is 
			moving to the right, you want to add a positive number (e.g., 5) to Ball1.X. When 
			the ball is moving to the left you want to add a negative number (e.g., -5). The 
			amount you add to Ball1.X is dependent on the direction the ball is moving.
		</p>
		<img class="thumbnail" src="../../assets/img/variables/circleSize.png" border="0"/>
		<p>To remember which way the ball is going, you define the variable distance. distance is initialized to 5, so when the app starts each timer event moves the ball to the right. When the ball hits the (right) edge, <span class="empfont">Ball1.EdgeReached</span> is triggered, and distance is set to itself times -1, or -5. In other words, its sign is flipped. Because distance is -5, the next timer events cause the ball to move left. When the ball hits the left edge, <span class="empfont">Ball1.EdgeReached</span> is triggered again, the sign of distance is flipped again, back to 5, and the ball begins moving right. This behavior continues so that the ball moves back and forth forever.
		</p>
		<p>Note: there are many ways to code this back-and-forth behavior and some that don’t include using a variable.</p>
