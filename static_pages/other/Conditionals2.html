<h2>Conditionals: How do you program an app to make decisions?</h2>
          <p>
			With App Inventor, you program event handlers-- how an app should respond
			to something like the user clicking a button. But sometimes an app shouldn't 
			respond to an event the same every time. This is where 
			<span class="empfont">if</span> blocks, known
			as "conditionals", come in. They allow the app to make decisions and
			form the basis of artificial intelligence.

<h3>Example 1. How do you start and pause a sound file when the user clicks a button?</h3>

<p>
This behavior from the <a href="/IHaveADream-steps">I Have a Dream app</a> illustrates the fundamental way that an app 
makes decisions. There is a button with a picture of Martin Luther King on it. The action 
taken when the button is clicked is not always the same. If the sound file (MLK’s speech) 
is playing, it should be paused. If it is not playing, it should be started.
The <span class="empfont">if-else</span> block is used to branch based on the situation. It checks the 
IsPlaying property of the <span class="empfont">Player</span> component. If it is true, it pauses the speech. 
If it is false (else), the speech is (re-) started.</p>

<h3>Example 2. How do you auto-respond to a “WHERE” text from a particular person?</h3>
<img class="thumbnail" src="../../assets/img/conditionals/textParticular.png" border="0"/>
<p>
	If your child or friend leaves this app running, you can always find out where they are
	 by sending a “WHERE” text to them. This code illustrates a complex if-test, one with 
	 an “and” clause, as you must test that both the sender is a particular phone number 
	 and the text sent was “WHERE”. If both are true, a text auto-reply is sent back to the phone number.
