			The LocationSensor communicates with GPS satellites and other mechanisms to 
			determine the location of your phone/tablet.

		   <p>
			The <span class="empfont">LocationSensor.LocationChanged</span> event is triggered 1) when the app first 
			gets a reading from the GPS satellites or other mechanisms, and 2) when the phone 
			or tablet’s location changes. If you are walking around, it could trigger many times. 
			You can control how often LocationChanged is triggered with the <span class="empfont">LocationSensor.TimeInterval</span> 
			and <span class="empfont">LocationSensor.DistanceInterval</span> properties. The TimeInterval is set to 60,000 ms, or 
			1 minute, by default. This means that <span class="empfont">LocationChanged</span> will only be triggered again after one minute. 
			</p><p>
			In this sample, the location readings are displayed in labels. Latitude and longitude 
			are numbers, while the <span class="empfont">currentAddress</span> property provides a street address for your current 
			location. As you walk around, you’ll see the numbers and address change.

		<p>
			App Inventor doesn’t provide a “distance” block for computing the distance between 
			two GPS coordinates. But there are known mathematical formulas for approximating 
			such a distance between two points. The solution is to create your own block-- a procedure-- 
			and plug in one of the known formulas. The procedure “distance”  above uses a formula 
			from <a href="http://geokoder.com/distances">http://geokoder.com/distances</a>. 

		Once you have a distance procedure, you can call it as in the bottom row of the <span class="empfont">LocationChanged</span> 
		event handler. This sample computes the distance from your current location and the University 
		of San Francisco campus.
