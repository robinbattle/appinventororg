          <h2>How do you do something to every item in a list?</h2>
          <p>
			Data lists are found in many apps. When you use Facebook, for instance, there
			is a list of your friends, a list of your status updates, etc. In your own app,
			 you might keep track of your friends phone numbers, a list of your past scores
			  in a game, or the number of miles you ran each day last week. With just about
			   any software, there is probably data lists involved.
        </p><p>
         App Inventor, like most languages, provides a way to process the items of a 
         list, to perform the same operation on each item. With App Inventor, you typically 
         use a <span class="empfont">for each in list</span> block. Check out the following examples: 
		  </p>
			 
			 <a name="textAll"></a> 
		  <h3>Example 1. How do you send a text to a list of your friends?</h3>
		    <img class="thumbnail" src="../../assets/img/Lists/textList.png" border="0"/>
		   <p>
		   The list <span class="empfont">phoneNumberList</span> is defined at the top. It has “concrete” data (e.g., 
		   the three fictitious phone numbers). Most apps store dynamic, user-generated data,
		    but for this example we’ll focus on the processing once you have a list.
			</p><p>
			The blocks inside the for each block are repeated for each item in the given 
			list <span class="empfont">phoneNumberList</span>. In this case, there are three items, so the three inner 
			blocks will be repeated three times. Nine total blocks will be executed 
			(“executed” is the computer science term for performing the operation that 
			the block defines. Don’t worry, nobody is being killed!). The text “Missing 
			you” will be sent to all three numbers. The <span class="empfont">for each in list</span> is called a 
			“loop” because the app loops up to the top of the <span class="empfont">for each</span> after executing 
			the bottom inner block. In computer science terminology, we say the app iterates 
			through the items.
			</p><p>

			The parameter item defined in the for each is a placeholder and always
			 holds the current item being processed. The first time through the loop 
			 it is “111-1111”. The second time through it is “222-2222”, and the third 
			 time it is “333-3333”. Thus all the numbers are sent the message.

			<h3>Example 2. How do you add up a list of numbers?</h3>
			<img class="thumbnail" src="../../assets/img/Lists/addNumbers.png" border="0"/>
			<p>
			The list of numbers in this example is fixed, but generally the list would be 
			dynamic, user-generated data, e.g., in a workout app the user would enter the 
			miles they ran each day and the data would be stored in a list.
			</p>
			<p>
			The for each in list block is used to iterate through the numbers. item is the 
			placeholder variable-- it holds the current number each time the row of blocks
			 within the for each is executed. The first time item is 7, then 3, then 11, 
			 then 5. The variable total is defined to store the running sum. On the first 
			 iteration, total is set to its previous value (0) plus item, which is 7, so 
			 it becomes 0+7=7. On the second iteration, total is set to its previous value 
			 (7) plus item, which is 3, so it becomes 7+3=10. After the third iteration 
			 total is 21 and after the fourth iteration total is 26 and the foreach 
			 completes. After the <span class="empfont">for each</span> loop, the total is displayed in a label 
			 (so someone will see the fruits of the apps labor!).
