<center><h1>App Inventor Articles and Videos</h1></center>
<p>App Inventor empowers even beginners and non-programmers to create mobile apps. This is
disruptive technology that opens up a new medium for creators-- interactive software for mobile devices-- 
that has until recently been restricted to the digital elite. The following articles and video
paint the picture of how App Inventor is helping democratize computing.

<ul>
<li>Steve Lohr, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/12/technology/12google.html?_r=2&th&emc=th">
Google's Do it Yourself App creation Software</a> NY Times, 2010. <br/><em>This article launched
App Inventor in 2010.</em></li>
<li>Clive Thompson,<a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/11/st_thompson_wereallcoders/"?>
Coding for the Masses</a>, Wired Magazine. <br/><em>This article talks about an app developed by a University of 
San Francisco student and how we need to provide more creators with coding skills. </em></li>
<li>Howard Wen,<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/06/google-app-inventor-programmers-mobile-apps.html">The Ascendance of App Inventor: David Wolber on why App Inventor isn't just 
for novices"</a> O'Reilly Rader Interview.<br/><em>Professor Wolber discusses why
App Inventor works and how it is different from traditional coding.</em></li>
<li>Hal Abelson, 
<a href="http://www.educause.edu/EDUCAUSE+Quarterly/EDUCAUSEQuarterlyMagazineVolum/MobileRamblings/225869">
Mobile Ramblings</a>, Educause. <br/><em>Professor Abelson provides the case for 
teaching mobile computing and why he created App Inventor. </em></li>
<li>Mike Loukides,<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/07/culture-wars.html">
App Inventor and the Culture Wars</a>, O'Reilly Radar.<br/><em>Loukides puts App
Inventor in perspective. </em></li>
<li>Clay Shirky, <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/situated_software.html">
Situated Software</a>.<em> Shirky makes the case that not every software project needs
to be for the masses, but instead can solve a personal, small group, or what he calls
"situated" need.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2> Discussion Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>
(Lohr, Abelson articles) What does Hal Abelson mean when he says, “The goal is to enable people to 
become creators, not just consumers, in this mobile world”? In what ways would attaining this goal help the world? 
</li>
<li>
(Thompson article) Consider this quote from Clive Thompson:
<blockquote> 
“Software, after all, affects almost everything we do. Pick any major problem—global warming, health care, 
or, in Finnegan’s case, highway safety—and clever software is part of the solution. Yet only a tiny chunk of 
people ever consider learning to write code, which means we’re not tapping the creativity of a big chunk of society.”
</blockquote>
Why do you think society hasn’t “tapped the creativity of a big chunk of society”? in terms of software development? 
</li>
<li>
(all articles) How does App Inventor help tap the creativity of a broader group of people? 
What are some cool apps that have been developed with App Inventor?
</li>
<li>
(Loukadis article, others)  Why was Android chosen as the platform for App Inventor instead of iPhone?
</li>
<li>
(Shirky, Abelson articles) What is situated software? Can you envision a world where ordinary people create personal 
software for their own phones and tablets?
</li>
<li>
(Videos) Do you think App Inventor can help young people learn software skills that will help them be more 
creative? What is STEM? How is App Inventor helping teach high schoolers?
</li>
